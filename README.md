# SillyClassroom

To start a program locally you need to do the following steps:

- open terminal
- (First-time setup only: If you do not have a `package.json` file, run `npm init` to create one)
- run `npm install` - to install all dependencies
- If your `package.json` does not contain `"type": "module"`, add it to handle ES module imports in app.js.
- Start the program by running `node app.js` in the terminal.

- You're all set! Enjoy using SillyClassroom.
